# CatToyTestApp

This is a .Net core console app intended for testing various hardware for the HattoriMeowzo repository. Publish this project for linux-arm, and then transfer it over to the Pi. You can test the hc-sr501 pir motion detector, a servo and the raspberry pi camera (photos and videos), enabling you to easily confirm that you've wired everything properly and make it easier to adjust motion detector settings and well as focus for the camera.
